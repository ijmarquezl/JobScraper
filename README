Project to create a website that presents all the jobs found in different JobBoards online to concentrate all searches.

Parameters might be different, both in the advanced search and in the board presentation.

The app will crawl the boards with the corresponding username and passwd in order to retrieve the latest opportunity updates from each site.
Later it will save the new information in a database.

Another component will display the results in a dynamic website.
